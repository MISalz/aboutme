  <h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>Born in Mexico and migrated to the US at the age of 8. Moved around alot and lived in most areas of California from Stockton to San Diego and everywhere in between. A sibling of 3 and being the only girl I learned to stand up for myself. Eventually I moved to Arizona at the start of my highschool year and lived there for over 24 years. I have 3 children 2 young adults and one highschooler. <br>
<br>
Attended college in Arizona and achieved a AAS degree in Computer Science. I have worked in the Medical reimbursement industry for over 13 years starting from the bottom to the top. I led and managed 2 billing centers with a staff on and off site. In 2019 I changed career path and worked as a Business analyst for a meetings procurement company. But an opportunity came up to move to Washington state and now im a Washingtonian. Currently I work for a major medical facility in downtown Seattle. 
<br>
<br>
During school and in my previous positions I was able to learn coding: HTML, CSS, Java, SQL and some VBA. This has really opened my eyes to what really drives me and it is exiting to change course and attend codefellows with the goal to become a software developer.</p>
